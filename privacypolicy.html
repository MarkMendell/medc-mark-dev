MobileCode can read the files you browse to open in it. These files are only edited in place and not shared to any location external to the local app on your device or the folder the file originally resides in. The app has the internet permission which it uses to update the message on the main menu screen. It does two GET HTTP requests to github pages .txt files. There is a log file of app activity stored in the private app directory and cleared on each new app startup. This log file is private to the app and not shared anywhere. The only talking to the outside world that this app does is those two GET requests to the github pages site.
